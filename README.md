# Lyft_Bay_Wheels_Project

## Problem Statement
You're a data scientist at Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels), formerly known as Ford GoBike, the company running Bay Area Bikeshare. You are trying to increase ridership, and you want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so.

What deals do you offer though? Currently, your company has several options which can change over time. Please visit the website to see the current offers and other marketing information. Frequent offers include:

Single Ride
Monthly Membership
Annual Membership
Bike Share for All
Access Pass
Corporate Membership
etc.

## Solution

My solution for Lyft Bay Wheels is to have single membership and monthly membership options. The single memberships will be catered to those on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday who are on vacation as we see an uptick of users all day. The monthly memberships should be for those who work Monday through Friday and use it for commuting.
